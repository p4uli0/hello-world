# hello-world
I'm new to this so just following the guide! Wish me luck...

I'm a HR and Payroll applications consultant for a market leading HR and Payroll Softwarehouse. Having spent 5 years as a consultant delivering the implementation of specific HR modules and learning basic code like HTML and CSS I have now decided to progress my careeer and have enrolled at the Open University on a Computing and IT course. My course starts in October 2017, but I wanted to enhance my knowledge before the course so I have started to look into Python programming. 

My aim is to become a Software Developer, and I want to create market leading applications that will rival and eventually overcome the software that I currently install for customers (specifically within the Recruitment industry).
